# Models: 

weak ping, ing, ampa mediated (thalamus)

For ampa mediated see, http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00869/full 

Sub network stim. Driver?


# API

## Free

-we, wi, dt, I, rate

## Fix

ING `I->E`, PING: `E<->I`, F: `E(Iapp)`, p, C, N, `w_ee = 0, w_ei, w_ie = ?`


# measures: 

kappa, synch (two ways?), binned cost (Or Purpa?), PSD, x/acor

Compares the stim sequence directly, ala pacological.


# Qs:

Consider monicka's disynaptic and terry's synch comm examples?
read gerstner, look up that negative perturbation paper
